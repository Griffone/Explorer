Would you like to understand how the fancy graphics work under the hood? Get an intuitive sense for how games show so much on the screen? Then you've come to the right place! In the *rendering deepdive* series you'll be able to work up an intuitive understanding of how do graphics actually work!

We'll start rather far - with primitives of the data used to represent 3D objects. And what is more primitive than a single point? A handful of coordinates will become our building block for more complex objects.
